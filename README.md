A repository of my configuration files on Arch Linux. 

I have a dual monitor setup so the awesome-wm configs will reflect that, there
is however a single monitor config as well in case my graphics card gives up.

I simply setup symlinks to files in this directory.

```shell
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/dircolors ~/.dircolors
```
