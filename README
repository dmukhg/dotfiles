This is a backup of all the important initial config files
in my home folder. Please note:
   - If you do use my .vimrc and do use the leo colorscheme
     or any of the other plugins do download the .vim directory
   - plugin shell scripts in the awesome directory are still in
     development using them might render your machine useless if
     you are using only awesome and no other session like gnome 
     or k
